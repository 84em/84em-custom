### Changelog Management

This plugin includes automated changelog generation based on Git commit history and tags.

#### Scripts

- **update-changelog.sh** - Generates `changelog.txt` from Git log, organized by tags/releases
- **tag-and-changelog.sh** - Creates a Git tag and automatically updates the changelog

#### Usage

To create a new release with automatic changelog generation:

```bash
./tag-and-changelog.sh v1.0.3 "Release version 1.0.3 with new features"
```

This will:
1. Create a Git tag with the specified name and message
2. Generate an updated changelog.txt file
3. Commit the changelog changes
4. Provide instructions for pushing to remote repository

**Note:** The changelog is automatically updated only when creating Git tags. Manual execution of `update-changelog.sh` is not supported to ensure changelog updates occur only when tags are added to the repository.

#### Changelog Format

The generated changelog follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format and includes:
- **[Unreleased]** - Commits since the latest tag
- **[Tag Version] - Date** - Commits included in each tagged release

#### Deployment Integration

The `deploy.sh` script handles deployment to the remote server. Changelog updates are handled separately through the tag creation process to ensure they only occur when Git tags are added.

### Gulp Integration

This plugin uses Gulp to optimize JavaScript and CSS files. The Gulp setup provides tasks for minifying JS files, optimizing CSS files, and watching for changes during development.

#### Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed
2. Navigate to the plugin directory in your terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

#### Available Commands

- `npm start` - Starts the development process with file watching
- `npm run build` - Builds optimized files for production

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp clean` - Removes previously generated minified files
- `gulp styles` - Optimizes CSS files
- `gulp scripts` - Minifies JavaScript files
- `gulp watch` - Watches for changes in source files
- `gulp build` - Builds all assets for production (cleans, then processes JS and CSS)

#### File Structure

The Gulp setup processes the following files:
- JavaScript: `inc/google-reviews-block/block.js` → `inc/google-reviews-block/block.min.js`
- CSS: 
  - `inc/google-reviews-block/style.css` → `inc/google-reviews-block/style.min.css`
  - `inc/google-reviews-block/editor.css` → `inc/google-reviews-block/editor.min.css`

## Usage

Most features work automatically after activation. The plugin enhances your site's SEO, performance, and functionality without requiring manual configuration.

### Shortcodes

- `[last_updated]` - Displays the last updated date of a post or page

## XML Sitemap

The plugin automatically generates an XML sitemap at the root of your website (`sitemap.xml`). The sitemap is updated whenever a post, page, or project is published, with a 5-minute delay to prevent excessive regeneration.

## Version

Current version: 1.0.6
